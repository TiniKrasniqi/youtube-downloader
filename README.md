- **Video mode** ‚Äì Switch to MP4 downloads and choose the resolution that fits your storage or screen (480p up to 4K).
- **Smart file organization** ‚Äì Playlists get their own folders and tidy filenames so your library stays orderly.
- **Real-time progress** ‚Äì Modern CustomTkinter UI shows per-item progress, ETA, speed, and detailed logs.
